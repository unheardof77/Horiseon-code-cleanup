# Horiseon Website Update

## Description

I was tasked with taking an existing website and formatting it for increased legibility.  Part of this process was removing out-dated code and replacing it with its successor.  This allows for the code to be easier read by the next developer.  Furthermore I was tasked with increasing the SEO, or search engine optimization.  To achieve optimal SEO I added meta tags and edited the title.
